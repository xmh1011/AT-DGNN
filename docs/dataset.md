# Dataset

## Notice

There is our sample data in the [example](../example) directory. You can refer to the [steps](./run.md) we provide to reproduce the experimental results. The format of the data is the same as the DEAP dataset, except that the D and L labels are missing. The DEAP dataset assigns a score (0-10) to the tags to reflect the sentiment, and we classify the tags by dichotomy (0 or 1). You can also run our model on the DEAP dataset along with other models in the codebase. We also provide methods to run our code on the deap dataset. 

Since the paper is under review and has not been officially accepted, we cannot provide you with the complete dataset for the time being. If you have questions about the dataset or the code, feel free to email me. I'll try my best to help you out. Waiting for the paper to be accepted, we will release the dataset and let you know ASAP. Thank you for your attention. I hope we can keep in touch and communicate in time if there are any questions.

If you like, you can leave your email [here](https://github.com/xmh1011/AT-DGNN/issues/13) or email to me at [xmh001011@gmail.com](mailto:xmh001011@gmail.com), if this article is accepted, we will email you ASAP.

If you have any question about our code and dataset, welcome to email me.
